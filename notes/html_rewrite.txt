when i create a chunk of html, i want to be able to select it.
the selector is the variable that lives and gets passed around

Rather than something like:
    hc.CssChunk(self.get_selector(SelectorType.KEY), {
        'text-align': alignment.key_alignment,
    }),

We want somehting like
    hc.CssChunk(key_selector, {
        'text-align': alignment.key_alignment,
    }),

and in doc construction what we're really doing is creating this library of key_selectors
do we need extra knowledge about them?
