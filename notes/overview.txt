training loop needs to:
    create html + css document
    convert to pdf

for inferece
    OcrProvider:
        ingest pdf
        convert to images
        ocr images
        convert ocr format to Doc obj

    save doc obj

    preproc:
        add per-word tags
            regex matches
                address
                phone number
                number
            character type counter
                uppercase alpha
                lowercase alpha
                numbers
                special

    create y values
        what do my y values look like?
            depends on the model.
            might be "this is a key, this is a value.  they go together"
                how do you phrase that?  key id, value id?  depends on how the objective function is implemented i guess
            might be "this is the value for field 7"
            those get created from the html.  but they need to have ocr in order to know word ids.
                still doesn't
            really my true y values are strings, where they are located is secondary, but would be nice to have

    display:
        ocr detections
            html doc with doc image as bg and ocr laid on top.
                ocr text alpha is set to 0%.  blue border pixel and 20% alpha fill for boxes.
        interface is web form on left.
            three versions:
                kv:
                    keys and values are joined together into a single box.
                        click on one, and you can edit it,
                            first by dragging (reset field value on drag start)
                            then you can edit text if necessary
                        you can also click the plus button to create a new double box
                field dict:
                    there's a web form on the left with field names
                    you start in field 1, then you move
                combined version:
                    detect k/vs, you can match a new key to each field def
                    on a new doc, detected keys are matched to their majority vote field definition by default.
                    you can drag them to another instead if you want.
