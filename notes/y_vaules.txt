how to create y values?
the problem is the ocr loop.
when i drop down to pdf / images, i lose all word id data
should i replace each word with an equallyish sized unique number?
    that'd work well for monospace fonts at least
    get word length, replace with numbers of equal length
    throw into a set to ensure uniqueness

but how should i do it in general?
the best way would be to fake the ocr output in the first place
it'd save a couple of seconds in generating each doc
it'd also be future proof if i could really do it.
best would be to create the web page pdf
    and for each word, find its location on the rendered doc
how?
    use something like selenium
    if the window can be set to the exact right pixel size


could surround each word with a tiny box with a wordid label
render at super high res, like 800dpi or something to support tiny wordid font
then do ocr and snag the wordid labels to get their location.  downsize by a factor of ~2 to the target size
then regenerate at normal dpi -- 400 or something -- without the wordid labels
