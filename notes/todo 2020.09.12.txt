add preprocessing pipeline before generating x.csv
once we get to x.csv all processing should be done.  it's just load and train

need to:
    convert special word types to special tokens
        <number>
        <date?> (maybe just <number/number/number or number.number.number or number-number-number)
        i've already got number counters and special char counters
        add total char counter
        "looks like date" field?
        "looks like part of address" field?

    convert words to embeddings
